# Void Engine - A WIP Windows native DX12 rendering engine 
This project is a way for me to practice building larger c++ applications and learn a new rendering API. It is still very much a work in progress as I am slowly building out the abstraction layers over the core D3D APIs. My final goal is to have a threaded, complete rendering engine that can process and render simple scene efficiently. 

## Extra Build Instructions
This engine uses Microsoft DirectXTex https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex to load and process textures. This project needs to be cloned and added to the solution for the engine to build.
